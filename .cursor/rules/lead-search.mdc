# Lead search process (demi-leads)

## Output contract (must follow)
- **Intermediate artifacts**: markdown files in `lead-search/<client>/` (auditable, with **source URLs**).
- **Final deliverable**: `lead-search/<client>/leads.csv` containing **20 named leads** (people + roles) with reasoning and evidence URL.

## Evidence policy (hard rule)
- Never write bare claims. Every extracted fact must include a `source_url` (or `evidence_urls[]`).
- Prefer **official event exhibitor detail pages** as the primary evidence primitive.
- Do not fabricate employee counts; unknown must be `null`.

## Required artifact sequence (keep filenames)
Create and maintain these files under `lead-search/<client>/`:
1. `00-sources.md`
2. `01-exhibitors-raw.md`
3. `02-exhibitors-clean.md`
4. `03-fit-screening.md`
5. `04-market-filter.md`
6. `05-prioritized-companies.md`
7. `06-personas.md`
8. `leads.csv`

## Working definitions
- **CONEXPO** means CONEXPO-CON/AGG and its official exhibitor directory (for the relevant year).
- **US market**: HQ in US or major US operations.
- **DACH market**: HQ in Germany/Austria/Switzerland or major operations there.
- **Company size**: small <200; large ≥200; unknown treated as small until verified.

## Persona targeting rules
- **Small**: prioritize **R&D / Engineering leadership** (hydraulics/fluid power-related).
- **Large**: prioritize **Strategic Procurement / Sourcing** and **R&D Hydraulics / Fluid Technology**.

## CSV schema (must match)
`number,first_names,last_name,company_name,industry,position,market,country_hq,employee_count,size_segment,buyer_fit,hydraulics_relevance,score,reasoning,source_url`
