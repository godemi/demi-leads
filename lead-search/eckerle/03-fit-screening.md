# Buyer-fit screening — Eckerle × CONEXPO 2026

Heuristic used:
- **Buyer-likely** if the company is a construction equipment OEM / integrator / end-user brand (uses hydraulics/fluid power), not primarily a competing hydraulics component manufacturer.
- **Hydraulics relevance** evidence via: (a) product categories in the CONEXPO directory, and (b) CONEXPO “New Product Showcase”/descriptions mentioning hydraulics or hydraulics-adjacent equipment.
